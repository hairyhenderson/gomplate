A [Go template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/)-based CLI tool. `gomplate` can be used as an alternative to
[`envsubst`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/envsubst-Invocation.html) but also supports
additional template datasources such as: JSON, YAML, AWS EC2 metadata, [BoldDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt),
[Hashicorp Consul](https://www.consul.io/) and [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) secrets.

I really like `envsubst` for use as a super-minimalist template processor. But its simplicity is also its biggest flaw: it's all-or-nothing with shell-like variables.

Gomplate is an alternative that will let you process templates which also include shell-like variables. Also there are some useful built-in functions that can be used to make templates even more expressive.
