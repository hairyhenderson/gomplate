const backendHelp = `
The "radius" credential provider allows authentication against
a RADIUS server, checking username and associating users
to set of policies.

Configuration of the server is done through the "config" and "users"
endpoints by a user with approriate access mandated by policy.
Authentication is then done by suppying the two fields for "login".

The backend optionally allows to grant a set of policies to any 
user that successfully authenticates against the RADIUS server, 
without them being explicitly mapped in vault.
