  Learn about Vault's plugin system.

# Plugin System
Certain Vault backends utilize plugins to extend their functionality outside of
what is available in the core vault code. Often times these backends will
provide both builtin plugins and a mechanism for executing external plugins.
Builtin plugins are shipped with vault, often for commonly used implementations,
and require no additional operator intervention to run. Builtin plugins are
just like any other backend code inside vault. External plugins, on the other
hand, are not shipped with the vault binary and must be registered to vault by
a privileged vault user. This section of the documentation will describe the
architecture and security of external plugins. 

# Plugin Architecture
Vault's plugins are completely separate, standalone applications that Vault
executes and communicates with over RPC. This means the plugin process does not
share the same memory space as Vault and therefore can only access the
interfaces and arguments given to it. This also means a crash in a plugin can not
crash the entirety of Vault.

## Plugin Communication
Vault creates a mutually authenticated TLS connection for communication with the
plugin's RPC server. While invoking the plugin process Vault passes a [wrapping
token](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/response-wrapping.html) to the
plugin process' environment. This token is single use and has a short TTL. Once
unwrapped, it provides the plugin with a unique generated TLS certificate and
private key for it to use to talk to the original vault process. 

## Plugin Registration
An important consideration of Vault's plugin system is to ensure the plugin
invoked by vault is authentic and maintains integrity. There are two components
that a Vault operator needs to configure before external plugins can be run, the
plugin directory and the plugin catalog entry.

### Plugin Directory
The plugin directory is a configuration option of Vault, and can be specified in
the [configuration file](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/index.html).
This setting specifies a directory that all plugin binaries must live. A plugin
can not be added to vault unless it exists in the plugin directory. There is no
default for this configuration option, and if it is not set plugins can not be
added to vault.

~> Warning: A vault operator should take care to lock down the permissions on
this directory to ensure a plugin can not be modified by an unauthorized user
between the time of the SHA check and the time of plugin execution.

### Plugin Catalog
The plugin catalog is Vault's list of approved plugins. The catalog is stored in
Vault's barrier and can only be updated by a vault user with sudo permissions.
Upon adding a new plugin, the plugin name, SHA256 sum of the executable, and the
command that should be used to run the plugin must be provided. The catalog will
make sure the executable referenced in the command exists in the plugin
directory. When added to the catalog the plugin is not automatically executed,
it instead becomes visible to backends and can be executed by them. For more
information on the plugin catalog please see the [Plugin Catalog API
docs](/api/system/plugins-catalog.html).

An example plugin submission looks like:

```
$ vault write sys/plugins/catalog/myplugin-database-plugin \ 
    sha_256=<expected SHA256 Hex value of the plugin binary> \
    command="myplugin"
Success! Data written to: sys/plugins/catalog/myplugin-database-plugin
```


### Plugin Execution
When a backend wants to run a plugin, it first looks up the plugin, by name, in
the catalog. It then checks the executable's SHA256 sum against the one
configured in the plugin catalog. Finally vault runs the command configured in
the catalog, sending along the JWT formatted response wrapping token and mlock
settings (like Vault, plugins support the use of mlock when available).

# Plugin Development
Because Vault communicates to plugins over a RPC interface, you can build and
distribute a plugin for Vault without having to rebuild Vault itself. This makes
it easy for you to build a Vault plugin for your organization's internal use,
for a proprietary API that you don't want to open source, or to prototype
something before contributing it back to the main project.

In theory, because the plugin interface is HTTP, you could even develop a plugin
using a completely different programming language! (Disclaimer, you would also
have to re-implement the plugin API which is not a trivial amount of work.)

~> Advanced topic! Plugin development is a highly advanced topic in Vault, and
is not required knowledge for day-to-day usage. If you don't plan on writing any
plugins, we recommend not reading this section of the documentation.

Developing a plugin is simple. The only knowledge necessary to write
a plugin is basic command-line skills and basic knowledge of the
[Go programming language](http://golang.org).

Your plugin implementation needs to satisfy the interface for the plugin
type you want to build. You can find these definitions in the docs for the
backend running the plugin.

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/hashicorp/vault/plugins"
)

func main() {
	plugins.Serve(new(MyPlugin), nil)
}
```

And that's basically it! You would just need to change MyPlugin to your actual
plugin.
