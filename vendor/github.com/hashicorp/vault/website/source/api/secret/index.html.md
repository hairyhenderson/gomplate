# Secret Backends

Each secret backend publishes its own set of API paths and methods. These
endpoints are documented in this section. Secret backends are mounted at a path,
but the documentation will assume the default mount points for simplicity. If
you are mounting at a different path, you should adjust your API calls
accordingly.

For the API documentation for a specific secret backend, please choose a secret
backend from the navigation.
